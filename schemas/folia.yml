annotationtype_doc:
    text:
        name: "Text Annotation"
        description: "Text annotation associates actual textual content with structural elements, without it a document would be textless. FoLiA treats it as an annotation like any other."

    token:
        name: "Token Annotation"
        description: "This annotation type introduces a tokenisation layer for the document. The terms **token** and **word** are used interchangeably in FoLiA as FoLiA itself does not commit to a specific tokenisation paradigm. Tokenisation is a prerequisite for the majority of linguistic annotation types offered by FoLiA and it is one of the most fundamental types of Structure Annotation. The words/tokens are typically embedded in other types of structure elements, such as sentences or paragraphs."

        history: "Since the beginning"
    chunking:
        name: "Chunking"
        description: "Assigns shallow grammatical categories to spans of words. Unlike syntax annotation, chunks are not nestable. They are often produced by a process called Shallow Parsing, or alternatively, chunking."

        history: "since v0.7"
    dependency:
        name: "Dependency Annotation"
        description: "Dependency relations are syntactic relations between spans of tokens. A dependency relation takes a particular class and consists of a single head component and a single dependent component. In the sample ``He sees'', there is  syntactic dependency between the two words: ``sees'' is the head, and ``He'' is the dependant, and the dependency relation can be qualified as  something like ``subject'', as the dependant is the subject of the head word, but this depends on the user-defined set."

    timesegment:
        name: "Time Segmentation"
        description: "FoLiA supports time segmentation to allow for more fine-grained control of timing information by associating spans of words/tokens with exact timestamps. It can provide a more linguistic alternative to `Event Annotation`."

    gap:
        name: "Gap Annotation"
        description: "Sometimes there are parts of a document you want to skip and not annotate at all, but
include as is. This is where gap annotation comes in, the user-defined set may indicate the kind of gap. Common omissions
in books are for example front-matter and back-matter, i.e. the cover."
        history: "Since the beginning"
    note:
        name: "Note Annotation"
        description: "Structural annotation used for notes, such as footnotes or warnings or notice blocks."

        description: "FoLiA provides a facility to align parts of your document with other parts of your document, or even with parts of other FoLiA documents or external
resources, even in other formats. It thus allows linking resources together. We call this *alignments*. Within this context, the ``aref`` element is used to refer to the aligned FoLiA elements."
        history: "Revised since v0.8"
    complexalignment:
        name: "Complex Alignments"
        description: "Complex alignments are a stand-off extension of alignment annotation that allows for more complex alignments, such as word alignments that include

        name: "Semantic Role Annotation"
        description: "This span annotation type allows for the expression of semantic roles, or thematic roles. It is often used together with `Predicate Annotation`"
        history: "since v0.9, revised since v1.3 (added predicates)"
    metric:
        name: "Metric Annotation"
        description: "Metric Annotation is a form of higher-order annotation that allows annotation of some kind of measurement. The type of measurement is defined by the class, which in turn is defined by the set as always. The metric element has a ``value`` attribute that stores the actual measurement, the value is often numeric but this needs not be the case."
        history: "since v0.9"
    lang:
        name: "Language Annotation"
        description: "Language Annotation simply identifies the language a part of the text is in. Though this information is often part of the metadata, this form is considered an actual annotation."

        history: "since v0.10"
    part:
        name: "Part Annotation"
        description: "The structure element ``part`` is a fairly abstract structure element that should only be used when a more specific structure element is not available. Most
notably, the part element should never be used for representation of morphemes or phonemes! Part can be used to divide a larger structure element, such as a division, or a
paragraph into arbitrary subparts."
        history: "since v0.11.2"
    utterance:
        name: "Utterance Annotation"
        description: "An utterance is a structure element that may consist of words or sentences, which in turn may contain words. The opposite is also true, a sentence may consist of multiple
utterances. Utterances are often used in the absence of sentences in a speech context, where neat grammatical sentences can not always be distinguished."

categories:
    structure:
        name: "Structure Annotation"
        description: "This category encompasses annotation types that define the structure of a document, e.g. paragraphs, sentences, words, sections like chapters, lists, tables, etc... These types are not strictly considered linguistic annotation and equivalents are also commonly found in other document formats such as HTML, TEI, MarkDown, LaTeX, and others. For FoLiA it provides the necessary structural basis that linguistic annotation can build on."
        class: AbstractStructureElement
    inline:
        name: "Inline Annotation"
        description: "This category encompasses (linguistic) annotation types describing a single structural element. Examples are Part-of-Speech Annotation or Lemmatisation, which often describe a single token."
        class: AbstractInlineAnnotation
    span:
        name: "Span Annotation"
        description: "This category encompasses (linguistic) annotation types that span one or more structural elements. Examples are (Named) Entities or Multi-word Expressions, Dependency Relations, and many others. FoLiA implements these as a stand-off layer that refers back to the structural elements (often words/tokens). The layer itself is embedded in a structural level of a wider scope (such as a sentence)."
        class: AbstractSpanAnnotation
    subtoken:
        name: "Subtoken Annotation"
        description: "This category contains morphological annotation and phonological annotation, i.e. the segmentation of a word into morphemes and phonemes, and recursively so if desired. It is a special category that mixes characteristics from structure annotation (the ``morpheme`` and ``phoneme`` elements are very structure-like) and also from span annotation, as morphemes and phonemes are embedded in an annotation layer and refer back to the text/phonetic content they apply to."
        class: AbstractSubtokenAnnotation
    textmarkup:
        name: "Text Markup Annotation"
        description: "The text content element (``<t>``) allows within its scope elements of a this category; these are **Text Markup** elements, they always contain textual content and apply a certain markup to certain spans of the text. One of it's common uses is for styling (emphasis, underlines, etc.). Text markup elements may be nested."
