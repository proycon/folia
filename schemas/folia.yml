        description: "The ID of the element; this has to be a unique in the entire document or collection of documents (corpus). All identifiers in FoLiA are of the `XML NCName <https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-xmlschema-2-19990924/#NCName>`_ datatype, which roughly means it is a unique string that has to start with a letter (not a number or symbol), may contain numers, but may never contain colons or spaces. FoLiA does not define any naming convention for IDs."

    annotator:
        name: "annotator"

    gap:
        name: "Gap Annotation"
        description: "Sometimes there are parts of a document you want to skip and not annotate at all, but
include as is. This is where gap annotation comes in, the user-defined set may indicate the kind of gap. Common omissions

notably, the part element should never be used for representation of morphemes or phonemes! Part can be used to divide a larger structure element, such as a division, or a
paragraph into arbitrary subparts."

    utterance:
        name: "Utterance Annotation"

        description: "This category encompasses annotation types that define the structure of a document, e.g. paragraphs, sentences, words, sections like chapters, lists, tables, etc... These types are not strictly considered linguistic annotation and equivalents are also commonly found in other document formats such as HTML, TEI, MarkDown, LaTeX, and others. For FoLiA it provides the necessary structural basis that linguistic annotation can build on."

        description: "This category encompasses (linguistic) annotation types that span one or more structural elements. Examples are (Named) Entities or Multi-word Expressions, Dependency Relations, and many others. FoLiA implements these as a stand-off layer that refers back to the structural elements (often words/tokens). The layer itself is embedded in a structural level of a wider scope (such as a sentence)."

    subtoken:
        name: "Subtoken Annotation"
        description: "This category contains morphological annotation and phonological annotation, i.e. the segmentation of a word into morphemes and phonemes, and recursively so if desired. It is a special category that mixes characteristics from structure annotation (the ``morpheme`` and ``phoneme`` elements are very structure-like) and also from span annotation, as morphemes and phonemes are embedded in an annotation layer and refer back to the text/phonetic content they apply to. Like words/tokens, these elements may also be referenced from ``wref`` elements."

    textmarkup:
        name: "Text Markup Annotation"
        description: "The text content element (``<t>``) allows within its scope elements of a this category; these are **Text Markup** elements, they always contain textual content and apply a certain markup to certain spans of the text.
