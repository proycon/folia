version: 2.0.0

Introduction
================

FoLiA, an acronym for **Format for Linguistic Annotation**, is a data model and file format to represent digitised
language resources enriched with linguistic annotation, e.g. linguistically enriched textual documents or transcriptions
of speech. The format is intended to provide a standard for the storage and exchange of such language resources,
including corpora and promote interoperability amongst Natural Language Processing tools that use the format.
